# UringNet Document

## Introduction

### Why I created this 

UringNet is a high performance network I/O framework. It is light weighted and developed by Golang. The foundation of UringNet is [io_uring](https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf) - a new async IO interface - from Linux Kernel since version 5.1 in 2019. This project just comes from experimental projects in my edge computing and IoT research. I am just want to find a way to build a simple but high performance network package transmit tool in IoT gateways. I have tried traditional select/epoll and then tried io_uring, finally , the io_uring get much better performance. 

### Should You adopt it in your project

Though UringNet is designed to be used in IoT platforms originally, it does provide basic TCP and UDP network functions. If your project really need to handle extremely huge data traffic, you can give it a try. 

In most cases, you could just use more mature network frameworks, for example, Go [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/)/[http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http), [netty](https://netty.io/), [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv).

## Get Started

UringNet extensively references existing network frameworks such as gnet and Netty, with some usage patterns closely resembling those of gnet. Please note that UringNet is based on io_uring and, therefore, requires running on the Linux operating system with a kernel version higher than or equal to 5.1.

### Install UringNet:

```shell
go get -u github.com/y001j/UringNet
```

### echo server example

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/y001j/UringNet"
	socket "github.com/y001j/UringNet/sockets"
	"os"
	"sync"
)

type testServer struct {
	UringNet.BuiltinEventEngine

	testloop *UringNet.Ringloop
	//ring      *uring_net.URingNet
	addr      string
	multicore bool
}

// OnTraffic 
//  
//	@Description: OnTraffic is a hook function that runs every read event completed
//	@receiver ts
//	@param data
//	@return uring_net.Action
func (ts *testServer) OnTraffic(data *UringNet.UserData, ringnet UringNet.URingNet) UringNet.Action {
	data.WriteBuf = data.Buffer
	return UringNet.Echo
}

func (ts *testServer) OnWritten(data UringNet.UserData) UringNet.Action {
	return UringNet.None
}

func (ts *testServer) OnOpen(data *UringNet.UserData) ([]byte, UringNet.Action) {

	return nil, UringNet.None
}

func main() {
	addr := os.Args[1]


	options := socket.SocketOptions{TCPNoDelay: socket.TCPNoDelay, ReusePort: true}
	ringNets, _ := UringNet.NewMany(UringNet.NetAddress{socket.Tcp4, addr}, 3200, true, 8, options, &testServer{}) //runtime.NumCPU()

	loop := UringNet.SetLoops(ringNets, 3000)
	var waitgroup sync.WaitGroup
	waitgroup.Add(1)
	loop.RunMany()
	waitgroup.Wait()
}

```

### Important APIs

```go
UringNet.NewMany(UringNet.NetAddress{socket.Tcp4, addr}, 3200, true, 8, options, &testServer{})
```

## Known Issues

> **Warning:** The project is still in development, there are still many bugs and performance issues. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please feel free to open an issue.

During our performance tests with wrk, we observed that UringNet requires a warm-up period during HTTP stress testing. Typically, a warm-up time of around 5 minutes is necessary to ensure that the UringNet test code reaches its peak performance, which surpasses the current fastest framework by more than 10%. I am still investigating the root cause of this behavior.
